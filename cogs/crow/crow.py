        Event leaderboard and point tracking commands.

        Leaderboards are calculated by adding up points for all members participating in an event. To create an event, use the `setup` command to tell the bot to monitor the event's channel. Then, react to messages with the üß© emoji. Any message with a üß© react will be counted for that event's score for that person, and can be applied by any mod/admin. The bot will react with üß© as an acknowledgement.

        By default, each üß© react earns the member 1 point, but each message only counts once, no matter how many people react. To change the point value, use `setup`. Higher point values may be useful for events that require more participation.

        If you need to count _more than one point_ for a message, you can use these reactions in any combination. They'll be added up:

        - üß© 1 point
        - üçí 2 points
        - üö• 3 points

        This bot also tracks seasons of events, however the capability to configure seasons is not yet supported. All events/channels and leaderboards will fall under "Season 1" for now.
